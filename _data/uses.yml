            I am teaching a summer Spanish program... [Cabra]'s a wonderful program and I highly recommend it to my students... [S]tudents become better at **judging their own mastery** of a subject. They aren't just memorizing material, but exercising some **higher-order thinking skills**.

            **Works flawlessly at what it does**, very nice clean interface. I love the mass card creator. Oh, and the fact that both **Chrome and Android versions have the same features and layout** is awesome. The syncing is great.
